/*
    an insurance company wants to send a floor plan (an n-by-m array of "rooms"), which is pre-seeded with a set of guards (denoted by -1 ), and locked rooms (denoted by -2) and unreachable rooms (denoted by -3).  the interface should return the floor plan with each "room" (a location in the x-y plane) coded with a value > 0 with the distance to the nearest guard.


thoughts:

    - insurance is a relatively undisrupted market and is likely not basing on guard distance; to innovate in the insurance market, this is likely the wrong entry point.  additionally, most museums have a number of technical components which augment guards such as motion detection, movement (of object) sensors, laser grid, etc.  most novel attacks against museums ignore guard locations by moving the guards around or distracting them to increase guard distance.  but conceptually, a motion detector is a lot like a guard that never has to take breaks, so the analysis can be useful either way.  since insurance is fairly undisrupted, the data set for this likely already exists inside of a company like barclay's or another large insurance company in london/new york (the two major global financial hubs), and is probably adjusted based on lived experience of the firms.
    - this would be a poor market entry choice for a net-new business as software isn't the defining characteristic but rather brand trust and corporate history (rightly or wrongly)
    - reminds me of Dijkstraâ€™s and other shortest path algorithm mechanisms, which i have no prior experience in; those use existing costs, in this case, we're calculating costs
